excerpt: 'In the life cycle of highly automated systems operating
in an open and dynamic environment, the ability to adjust
to emerging challenges is crucial. For systems integrating data-driven AI-based components, rapid responses to
deployment issues require fast access to related data for
testing and reconfiguration. In the context of automated
driving, this especially applies to road obstacles not included in the training data, commonly referred to as out-ofdistribution (OoD) road obstacles. Given the availability of
large uncurated driving scene recordings, a pragmatic approach is to query a database to retrieve similar scenarios
featuring the same safety concerns due to OoD road obstacles. In this work, we extend beyond identifying OoD road
obstacles in video streams and offer a comprehensive approach to extract sequences of OoD road obstacles using
text queries, thereby proposing a way of curating a collection of OoD data for subsequent analysis. Our proposed
method leverages the recent advances in OoD segmentation and multi-modal foundation models to identify and efficiently extract safety-relevant scenes from unlabeled videos.
We present a first approach for the novel task of text-based
OoD object retrieval, which addresses the question “Have
we ever encountered this before?”'
