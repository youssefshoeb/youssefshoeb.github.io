Hi, my name is Youssef. I am a machine learning researcher specializing in autonomous driving perception systems at Continental AI Lab Berlin. My primary responsibility is developing algorithms for an automatic corner-case detection system. Additionally, I conduct research on the same topic at the Technical University of Berlin, where I am pursuing a PhD in the Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Life Cycles faculty.

My main research interest lies in developing methods for safe AI, with a particular focus on Deep Learning, Open-World Learning, Out-of-Distribution Detection, Uncertainty Estimation, and Online Monitoring. Currently, I am concentrating on applications within the Autonomous Driving domain.
